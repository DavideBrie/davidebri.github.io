These are:  TCP Connect Scans (-sT)This perform a three-way handshake with the ports specified in the command. Depends on what we get back, we can figure it out how’s the port’s status.If we get back a RST flag set -&gt; the port is close;If we get back a SYN/ACK flag set -&gt; the port is open;What if we got nothing back? This mean that the port is hidden behind a firewall and it will be marked as filtered;  SYN Scans (-sS)Also known as stealth scan, is used to scan the TCP port-range of a prey(s).Keep in mind that this scan require sudo permission, because we need to create raw packets not the full TCP handshake.  UDP Scans (-sU)When a packet is sent to an open UDP port, there should be no response. When this happens, nmap refers to the port as being open or filteredAdditionally there are several less common port scan types like:  TCP Null Scans (-sN)Send TCP request is sent with no flags set at all, and if it’s closed it should send back the RST flag.  TCP FIN Scans (-sF)The request is sent with only the FIN  flag. Once again, nmap expects a RST if the port is closed.  TCP Xmas Scans (-sX)Send a malformed TCP packet, with only PSH, URG and FIN sets and expects a RST response for closed ports.Nmap Scripting Engine - NSEThis scripts, written in LUA, expands the nmap capability.The standard scripts, stored at /usr/share/nmap/scripts,  are divded by categorys such as: safe, intrusive, vuln, exploit, auth, brute and [many more](https://nmap.org/book/nse-usage.html).It’s possible to use this scripts typing:nmap &lt;IP_ADDRESS&gt; -sT -sS --script=&lt;CATEGORY&gt;and, if needed, it possible to parse some arguments to them with --script-args followed by the arguments.",

            "content_text": "Everybody nowadays experienced at least once, after inserting the login credentials to enter a website, the other “tedious” step of writing a temporary code, sent via text messages as token or generated via an authentication app (2FA).This last step can save your accounts to be hacked. Because it’s a One-Time 6 digit code and expires in less than a minute, can offer a second layer of security.Thus even if someone knows your login credentials or stole them, they still not be able to enter if they don’t have access to your 2FA app.This, in short, it’s how 2 Factor Authentication works.Why it’s called 2-Factor Authentication ❔To identify yourself into a system, you could be asked 3 main things:  Something you know.  Something you are.  Something you have.As can you imagine a two factor, involve 2 of these 3 things. An example, similar to 2FA, that we use in our everyday life, is when we go to an ATM to withdraw some money, we have a bank card and we know the pin of it. That are 2 factor.What about the something we are? We’re talking about biometrics, for example, fingerprint or face recognition, a great method, but still not perfect.How a 2FA code it’s made ⚙️If you’re not familiar, here’s a screenshot of the Google Auth app.As you can see, there is a code for each account and there is a little timer that lasts 30 seconds, at the end of it, it will generate a new one.This it’s basically made by an algorithm that randomly outputs a 6 digit code. This can be implemented in different ways, for example, they could be based on TOTP a Time-Based One-time Password.You may know wondering, since it’s random, how the site we are trying to log in is capable of recognizing the right 2FA code.When you enable this layer of security, the site will give you a QR code or a string, that we have to input in the app so it can start generating codes, for that site.That string is a secret key, assigned to your account, that it’s combined, in case the app used a TOTP-based algorithm, with a timestamp to generate a new code every 30 seconds.Can 2FA be reverse engeneered? 👨‍💻No. If we use a well-known third-party software and someone gets our code, they can’t use it to predict the new ones. The only method they have it’s to get access to the app that we use to generate codes.2FA Third-party apps - Wich is the best? 💭As always there are different options to choose from, but by my experience, I can tell that when you’re dealing with multiple accounts, my advice is Authy since having a lot of feature like:  Password protection  Push notifications  Encrypted Backups  And many more…And the migration from Google Authenticator was really easy.",
